A program to recommend new mountain biking trails to users based on their current favorites

# IMPORTANT Update
As of 4/1/2023, Trailforks is not allowing data to be scraped from their site. Additionally, their data use policy mentions that "Use of Trailforks data is only allowed via the Trailforks API." I'll now be contacting Trailforks for API access, and will no longer scrape their site as I was doing before. While I wait for a response from Trailforks.com (I've contacted them for API access before, and did not hear back), a potential alternative is mtbproject.com.
