# Trail Recommender
## Design Spec

An outline of the trail recommender's design. Note that this document is modeled off of the Dartmouth College COSC50 lab 3 design spec.

## User interface

Eventually, I will provide the trail recommender with an aesthetically pleasing UI (this will be done with a tool like PySimpleGUI). For the time being,
however, it will simply take user input with basic Python I/O.

## Inputs and outputs

*Input:* The user will input
 * the name of their favorite home trail
 * the name of a region that they're interested in traveling to

*Output:* 

  * a list of urls of the five trails in the specified region that are most similar to the user's favorite home trail.
  
  Note: For the time being, this output will be formatted as a series of links, but when the GUI interface is created for the trail recommender, the output   will be presented in a more aesthetically pleasing manner.
